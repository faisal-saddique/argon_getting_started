# Getting Started with Particle Argon

The Particle Argon is a powerful Wi-Fi and BLE enabled development board that can be programmed with Particle's cloud-based software platform. This guide will walk you through the steps to get started with your Particle Argon.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need the following:

- A Particle Argon board
- A USB cable
- A computer with an internet connection
- 

## Step 1: Set up your Particle account

1. If you don't already have one, create a Particle account at https://login.particle.io/signup.
2. Verify your email address by clicking the link in the email you receive from Particle.

## Step 2: Set up your Particle Argon

1. Connect your Particle Argon to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Put your Particle Argon into listening mode by holding down the "MODE" button until the RGB LED starts blinking blue.
3. In a web browser, navigate to https://setup.particle.io.
4. Follow the instructions on the page to set up your Particle Argon and connect it to Wi-Fi.

## Step 3: Use the Official Web IDE

1. In a web browser, navigate to https://build.particle.io/build/new to access the Particle Web IDE.
2. Log in to your Particle account.
3. Click on the "Libraries" tab and add any necessary libraries for your project.
4. Create a new project by clicking on the "Create New App" button.
5. Write your code in the editor and save the file.
6. Click the "Devices" button in the left-hand navigation pane and select your Particle Argon.
7. Click the "Flash" button to flash the code to your Particle Argon.
8. The RGB LED on your Particle Argon should now be blinking green, indicating that your code is running.

## Step 4: Use VS Code Workbench

1. Download and install the Particle Workbench extension for VS Code from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open VS Code and log in to your Particle account using the extension.
3. Click on the "Particle: Create New Project" button in the VS Code command palette.
4. Select the "argon" device type and follow the prompts to create a new project.
5. Write your code in the editor and save the file.
6. Click the "Particle: Flash application (local)" button in the VS Code command palette to flash the code to your Particle Argon.
7. The RGB LED on your Particle Argon should now be blinking green, indicating that your code is running.

Congratulations, you have successfully set up your Particle Argon and programmed it to blink an LED! This is just the beginning of what you can do with your Particle Argon, so keep exploring and have fun!
